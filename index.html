								<p>We believe in <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collective code ownership</a>. All the code belongs to everyone. Feel free to fix or improve any part of the code.</p>
								<p>We believe in <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">continuous refactoring</a>. If you come across something that you feel is not as good as it could be 
								(be it code, documentation, test data...) make a note to yourself or open an issue in the tracker and come back to it later, or improve it right away.</p>
								<p>We believe in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/">clean code</a>. Code quality and readability is of utmost importance. Choose your class, method and variable names carefully, 
								keep the code concise, respect the coding conventions, pay attention to formatting and to the order of declarations, etc.</p>
								<p>We believe in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/code-reviews-just-do-it.html">code reviews</a>. We need to share the knowledge of the code, and make sure it is as good as it can possibly be. 
								We'll ask you to review our code and we'll review yours.</p>
								<p>We believe in <a href="http://cam.ly/blog/2010/12/code-fearlessly/">fearless coding</a>. Don't get scared of experimenting and hacking your way around. 
								Unit tests, integration tests and Git are all here to make sure you don't break things.</p>
								<p>For documentation like for code: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">don't repeat yourself</a>.</p>
								<p>Know when to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appleseedhq/appleseed-wiki/master/images/bird-on-no-bird-sign.jpg">break these rules</a>. Software development cannot be reduced to a strict set of rules. Be measured and reasonable.</p>
